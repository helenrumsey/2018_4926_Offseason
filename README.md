# 2018_4926_Offseason_MasterCode
Master code for FRC team 4926 in the 2018 off season.  Used on our competition chassis
This code is the master code we used during the offseason competitions.  The code should acurately operate all the funtions on our competition chassis including driving, the elevator/lift, intake/outtake, pneumatic clamping on the cube, tilting the elevator pneumatically to fit in starting configuration, and a slide prevention to prevent the clamp from sliding and help us remain in starting configuartion. 
The autonomous code on the master version no longer works due to a change in the gear box ratio that changed our encoder counts. Please refer to additional branches of this code to understand the development on retuning the autonomous.
If your only purpose for using this code is for demoing the robot, this version should be valid.
